                Your journey has always been different ‚Äî not louder, not bigger ‚Äî just different. From a very young age, you carried a mindset that didn't quite match the world around you. And if I'm being honest, that was the first thing that drew me to you. People often questioned your mentality, but they don't know what it took ‚Äî or what it cost ‚Äî to think the way you do.
                <br /><br />
                You've always had a deep sense of responsibility, especially when it comes to the people you care about. Your journey made you cautious, conscious of stability and security in ways many people your age never had to be. While most were building websites or walking the usual paths, you were diving into cybersecurity ‚Äî a field with high risk, uncertain rewards, and very little recognition in the beginning.
                <br /><br />
                I haven't been there through all of it ‚Äî I've only heard fragments, the stories you've chosen to share. I've seen you stay up all night preparing for CTFs, pushing yourself quietly, without ever seeking attention. It wasn't about showing off ‚Äî it was about growing.
                <br /><br />
                You once told me you never wanted to be average. Just so you know ‚Äî you're not. And you never will be. When your cybersecurity journey didn't go the way you had envisioned, you accepted what went wrong and moved forward with more determination. And no matter where life takes you next, I hope you never stop believing in what you're capable of ‚Äî because your ability to rise after a fall will always take you further than anything else.
